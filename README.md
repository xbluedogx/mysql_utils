# Pinterest MySQL Management Tools

## Basics of MySQL at Pinterest

Pinterest has historically used MySQL to store some of our most important data:
  - **Pins**
  - **Boards**
  - **Image metadata**
  - **Usernames and passwords**

Recently, we have added additional use cases:
  - **Pinlater**
Thanks in part to kernel optimizations, MySQL is now replacing Redis and
becoming the only supported backend for our asynchronous job execution engine.
  - **Zen**
MySQL has joined HBase as a supported backend for our Graph Storage Engine.

In all of the environments that MySQL supports at Pinterest, the environment is
identical from an administrative perspective:
  - **A single master with one or two slaves**
Historically MySQL was used with multiple writable instances in a replica set.
This topology is error prone and has been simplified to a single master with
one or more slaves.
  - **Zookeeper provides service discovery**
The contract between the administrative tools and the MySQL applications is via
Zookeeper.  With few exceptions, Zookeeper provides clients with database
hostnames, usernames and passwords.

## The Lifecycle of a MySQL Instance in the Cloud

MySQL servers at Pinterest are launched, live, and die with only the rarest of 
configuration changes. Upgrading kernels, MySQL versions, and any other changes
that would require a restart of the database are never done in-place.  Instead,
these actions are always performed through server replacements and 
failovers/slave promotions as needed. This choice has greatly simplified our
automation by removing the need to manage intermediate state. 

One of our most important scripts is launch_replacement_db_host.py. In the
simplest case, the only required argument to launch_replacement_db_host.py is 
the hostname of a failed slave. The existing instance is examined, all required
parameters for a new server are computed, and then the new server is launched.
For other changes, such as MySQL upgrades, hardware upgrades/downgrades, and
datacenter migrations, there are optional arguments.

After the new server has booted and received its initial base configuration
from our provisioning system, a cron job will notice that the data directory is
empty and run mysql_restore_xtrabackup.py. Based on service discovery, this 
script will attempt to find a database backup, restore it, setup replication,
and then add the new MySQL instance to service discovery.  Like 
launch_replacement_db_host.py,  mysql_restore_xtrabackup.py accepts many 
optional arguments for non-standard uses.

If a MySQL master server requires replacement, the mysql_failover.py script
must be run to promote the primary slaves to master. This script deals with
either either living or dead initial masters, modifies MySQL replication
topology, and then updates service discovery.

After a server has been removed from service discovery, it will be subject to a
retirement queue system. This system has several steps that lead to the eventual
termination of a server:
  - Based on service discovery, servers that are not in use will have several
status counters reset.
  - After a day, the servers will be inspected to see if any activity has
caused the status counters to increment. If the counters have incremented, the
retirement process is aborted. If the counters have not incremented, the MySQL
instance is sent a shutdown command.
  - After another day, the server is subject to termination if its database has
not been restarted.

## Utilities

A list of included utilities:
  - **archive_mysql_binlogs.py**
This script backs up MySQL replication logs in order to be able to perform
point-in-time recoveries in the case where all servers in a replica set are
lost. All logs up to the current log being written to are uploaded to S3.
  - **check_mysql_replication.py**
This script displays replication status of an instance in terms of sql/io
thread status and bytes behind, a computed seconds behind master based on
pt-heartbeat. If a watch argument is supplied, normal output is suppess and
instead only a computed seconds behind master is displayed along with a
guestimate for replication catchup.
  - **find_shard_mismatches.py**
This script examines production servers and find any incorrectly located
shards.
  - **find_unused_db_servers.py**
This script finds unused servers based on service discovery and optionally add
the instances to the retirement queue.
  - **fix_orphaned_shards.py**
This script picks up where find_shard_mismatches.py left off and rename and then
eventually drops the unused shards.
  - **get_recent_checksums.py**
Use data populated by mysql_checksum.py to display current replication
consistency data.
  - **launch_amazon_mysql_server.py**
This script is generally called by launch_replacement_db_host.py and provides
an easy interface to correctly launch a new server in aws.
  - **launch_replacement_db_host.py**
This script accepts a hostname of an existing replica and then pulls a variety
of data from our cmdb and attempts to launch a server to replace the supplied
instance with a similar configuration. Optional additional arguments can
override the configuration in a variety of ways.
  - **modify_mysql_zk**
This script will modify our service discovery system in a variety of ways.
  - **mysql_backup_status.py**
This script checks that backups have run across all replica sets and optionally
display the created backup files.
  - **mysql_backup_xtrabackup.py**
This script is our primary backup system for MySQL. These backups are used by
mysql_restore_xtrabackup for building new MySQL instances.
  - **mysql_checksum.py**
This script is run every day, and runs a pt-checksum against a subset of the
shards in order to verify that master and slave are not out of sync and if so,
by how much. The mysql_checksum.py script runs the checksums and stores the
results.
  - **mysql_cli.py**
This script attempts to remove the need for users to know hostnames,
usernames and passwords in order to use the mysql cli. The script accepts
a replica set name or in some cases a shard name and will determine the
current hosts in productions and then launches a mysql cli in the shell
using a read only username and password. It can also use a variety of
privileges such as a read write connection or a admin connections. It can also
accept a hostname and automatically figure out usernames and passwords.
  - **mysql_cnf_builder.py**
This script builds MySQL configuration files based on global defaults, and then
overrides for workload type, hardware and MySQL version. Several example
configuration files are included.
  - **mysql_grants.py**
This script manages our database users. It is one of our oldest bits of
automation and one of our most limited. It fulfills our needs for the time
being but sooner or later will need to be significantly expanded.
  - **mysql_failover.py**
This script attempts to safely run a failover on a MySQL replica set, updating
replication topology and service discovery.
  - **mysql_grants.py**
This script provides an interface to check and correct db user configuration.
  - **mysql_init_server.py**
This script takes a server with mysql binaries installed and sets up an empty
mysql instance and then imports users.
  - **mysql_replica_mappings.py**
This script provides administrators a quick view of what is in production in a
format that is easy to use for shell scripting. The script can also pull in
hardware, availability zone, etc...
  - **mysql_restore_xtrabackup.py**
This script finds a backup, restores it, sets up replication and then
adds the new instance to service discovery based on data recorded by
launch_replacement_db_host.py.
  - **mysql_shard_status.py**
This script displays the status in service discovery of an instance. Primarily
used for gating cron jobs.
  - **purge_mysql_backups.py**
This script purges backup files on local disk, but takes no action on backups
in S3. 
  - **retirement_queue.py**
This script ensures that a server which is no longer in service discovery
is no longer in use and then terminates the instance.
  - **schema_verifier.py**
This script ensures that schema is in sync across sharded data sets.

## Not a Panacea
These tools are tightly integrated into our service discovery mechanism and
would likely require moderate modification of the code that reads and writes
from service discovery. There are also some significant legacy limitations to
these utilities, such as the lack of support for more than two slaves. It is
our hope that these tools are useful to other that wish to create automation
for their MySQL infrastructure.
